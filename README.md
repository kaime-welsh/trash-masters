# Trash Masters

**His Junk, Your Journey... Good Luck Staying Un-trashed!**

## Overview/About the Game

Welcome to the grimy, glorious, and utterly bizarre world of **Trash Masters**! Prepare to be unceremoniously yoinked from your mundane existence by the one and only **Trash Master** – a rather eccentric (and probably unsanitary) eldritch being with a penchant for… well, trash. You and your fellow abductees are the newest contestants in his twisted, sewer-based "game show."

**Trash Masters** is an online cooperative horror game built with the mighty **Godot Engine**. It plunges players into a procedurally generated labyrinth of filth and fright. The aesthetic is a unique cocktail – imagine if a gritty, realistic survival game had a love child with a slightly unhinged cartoon. It's horror, sure, but it’s the kind that elicits a nervous chuckle right before a shriek. We don't take ourselves *too* seriously, but the threat of becoming permanent sewer décor is very, very real.

## Key Features

* **Online Cooperative Multiplayer:** Team up with friends (or brave strangers) to survive the Trash Master's challenges. You'll need each other!
* **Procedural Level Generation:** No two runs are the same! Each level is a unique, stinking maze filled with randomly placed items, devious traps, mind-bending puzzles, and unsettling monsters.
* **Unique Objective-Based Gameplay:** The Trash Master has specific "treasures" in mind. Each player will be assigned a particular piece of trash to retrieve. Don't disappoint him.
* **Simple but Strategic Inventory:** Who needs complicated bags? You've got two hands! Each can hold one item. Choose wisely.
* **Intuitive 3-Item Crafting System:** Become a master of makeshift mayhem! Combine the two items in your hands with a third item you're eyeing on the ground. (Stick + Duct Tape + Knife on the ground = pointy Spear of Problem-Solving!)
* **Challenging Death Mechanics:** Death isn't *quite* the end... for your teammates, anyway. If you kick the bucket, you're out until a surviving teammate bravely (or luckily) reaches the next level.
* **Run-Based Progression:** If everyone bites the dust, the show's over and the run ends. Success means crafting better items and armor as you progress, hopefully extending your television career just a little longer.

## Story/Premise

So, there you were, minding your own business, and then BAM! You're in a sewer. A very large, very smelly, and very *occupied* sewer. Your host, the charismatic and slightly terrifying **Trash Master**, an eldritch entity of questionable hygiene and even more questionable motives, has "invited" you to participate in his grand game show. Why? Perhaps he's bored. Perhaps he's building the universe's weirdest collection. Perhaps he just really, *really* likes watching mortals scramble for garbage. Whatever his reasons, your new purpose is clear: find the specific pieces of junk he desires from the depths of his domain and bring them back. Or else.

## Gameplay Deep Dive

### The Goal
Each player receives a divine (or rather, eldritch) decree: a specific piece of trash they must locate within the current level and return to the Trash Master's designated collection point. Fulfill his request to proceed deeper into the sewer-plex!

### Cooperation is Key (to Not Becoming Mulch)
While you each have your own trash to track down, going it alone is a recipe for disaster. Watch each other's backs, share information about monster locations or trap placements, and maybe even help a buddy carry a particularly cumbersome piece of... "art." Remember, if one player makes it to the next level, fallen comrades get a second chance!

### Inventory & Item Interaction: The "Two Hands, No Pockets" Philosophy
Forget cumbersome backpacks. In the sewers, you travel light. You can hold **one item in each hand**, for a grand total of two items. This makes every choice critical. Do you carry a weapon and a quest item? Or two components for a crucial craft?

### Crafting: MacGyver Would Be Proud (or Horrified)
Crafting in Trash Masters is beautifully straightforward:
1.  Hold an item in your left hand.
2.  Hold an item in your right hand.
3.  Look at a third compatible item on the ground.
4.  *Combine!*

For example:
* You're holding a **Stick** (Hand 1).
* You're holding some **Duct Tape** (Hand 2).
* You spot a discarded **Knife** on the sewer floor (Ground Item).
* Combine them, and voila! You've crafted a trusty **Spear**.

What other magnificent (or monstrous) creations can you concoct from the refuse around you? A rusty pipe, a broken bottle, and a can of questionable beans? The possibilities are as endless as the Trash Master's sewer!

### Surviving the Sewers
The Trash Master's playground is not for the faint of heart. Each procedurally generated level is teeming with:
* **Monsters:** Unspeakable things that crawl, slither, and shamble in the dark.
* **Traps:** Cleverly (and cruelly) placed to end your trash-collecting career.
* **Puzzles:** Sometimes, brute force isn't enough. You might need to use your brain (what's left of it).

### Death and Consequences: The Ultimate Game Over (Almost)
* **Player Death:** If your health drops to zero, you're dead. No respawns within the current level. Your surviving teammates will have to mourn you (or loot your corpse, we don't judge).
* **Revival:** Hope is not lost! If at least *one* player successfully reaches the entrance to the next level, all deceased players are miraculously (or perhaps contractually) revived to continue the game show.
* **Total Party Kill:** However, if ALL players perish on a level, the Trash Master deems the show a flop. The run is over, and you'll have to start a fresh attempt from the beginning.
